            <h3>Where can I get ROMs of games?</h3>
            <p>
              ROMs can be obtained by many open source developers in the Gameboy

              on the GB/GBC platform, as well as aleady developer projects. In
              terms of commercial ROMs and games, downloading commercial ROMs is
              illegal, and frowned upon by the VaporBoy and WasmBoy authors.
              Though, depending on your contry, Dumping ROMs of cartridges you
              own, is legal. This process can be found online, by searching on
              the internet. For more information on the legality of ROMs and
              emulation, I found

            <h3>What file types are supported by VaporBoy?</h3>
            <p>
              VaporBoy uses WasmBoy as its emulation library, thus, it supports
              the same file types as WasmBoy. As of this time of writing,
              WasmBoy supports ".gb", ".gbc", and ".zip" files that contain the
              one of the other types.

        <h1>System Requirements & Performance</h1>
        <p>
          From manual testing, I've found that most laptops and desktops should
          be able to run the emulator at full speed easily. However, running
          emulators within a web browser is still a challenge for mobile
          browsers. I've found most flaship devices from 2016 and newer can tend
          to run the emulator at full speed. For instance, I've found that
          devices with a{" "}
          <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/" target="_blank">
            Geekbench

          single core score above 1400 have the best chance of running the
          emulator at a full 60 frames per second. For improving performance,
          check the <b>Control Panel > Configure Options > Performance</b>{" "}
          section. There you will see options for adjusting performance, with
          detailed explanations of what each option does.
